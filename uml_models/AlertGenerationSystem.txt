Patient Information and Threshold Alerts:
Every patient within the ward possesses a digital dossier within the Cardiovascular Health Monitoring System (CHMS). Within this dossier lie personalized thresholds for various vital signs, tailored according to each patient's distinct medical history and present condition. These thresholds denote critical values surpassing which necessitates immediate medical attention. For instance, one patient might have a heart rate threshold set at 130 beats per minute, while another might have a low blood pressure threshold set at 90/60 mm Hg.
Alert Generator:
The Alert Generator functions as a module tasked with continuously receiving and analyzing data streams originating from medical apparatus like heart rate monitors and blood pressure cuffs. Upon receiving this influx of data, it meticulously compares the readings against the individualized thresholds of each patient. This analysis unfolds in real-time to ensure swift responses to any anomalies detected.
Alert Trigger:
Should any vital sign breach a patient's predefined alert threshold, the Alert Generator initiates the creation of an Alert Trigger. This trigger encapsulates pertinent details such as the nature of the alert (e.g., heart rate or blood pressure), the patient's identity, the critical value breached, and the timestamp of the occurrence.
Alert Oversight:
Upon the creation of an Alert Trigger, oversight transitions to the Alert Oversight module. This module takes charge of disseminating the alert to the relevant medical personnel promptly. It guarantees that alerts are swiftly conveyed to staff members via mobile devices, workstations, or other communication platforms. The Alert Oversight module orchestrates the management and prioritization of alerts, ensuring the preservation of patient safety and the efficiency of clinical responses.
