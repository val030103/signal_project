When an alert threshold is triggered, whether due to a vital sign surpassing a predefined limit, equipment malfunction, or another critical event, an Alert is generated. This marks the inception of its lifecycle.

After generation, the Alert is automatically sent to relevant recipients, typically medical staff, via mobile devices, workstations, or other communication channels. This transition from "Generated" to "Sent" is facilitated by an AlertManager or similar coordinating component.

Upon receipt, medical staff must acknowledge the alert to confirm their awareness and action. This acknowledgment, transitioning from "Sent" to "Acknowledged," is essential for mitigating alert fatigue.

An Alert transitions to the "Resolved" state once the underlying issue is resolved, often through intervention by medical staff. This could entail administering medication or adjusting equipment to alleviate the critical condition. The transition from "Acknowledged" to "Resolved" is prompted by user action, usually a medical professional confirming resolution.

Throughout these transitions, the system maintains a comprehensive audit trail, documenting the creation, sending, acknowledgment, and resolution of each alert. This log is vital for analyzing response times, identifying trends in alert causes, and ensuring adherence to healthcare regulations. Additional actions, such as re-sending alerts or escalating them if necessary, may occur to ensure timely and appropriate responses.
