The Data Access Layer commences with the DataListener module, which serves as the initial recipient for all incoming data streams. Upon arrival, each data stream is directed for decryption to one of three translation classes: FileDataListener, TCPDataListener, or WebSocketDataListener. Any data that fails to align with these predefined classes is promptly rejected. Following reception by one of the aforementioned classes, the data undergoes analysis and translation into a standardized format suitable for utilization. Once this translation process is complete, the data proceeds to the DataParsers module, where it undergoes further standardization to ensure uniformity across all types of translations. In the event that the DataParsers encounter difficulty in this standardization process, an alert is dispatched to the AlertGenerator module, which initiates a system alert to prevent unidentified data from infiltrating the system. Assuming successful processing by the DataParsers, the data is then passed on to the DataSourceAdapter module for processing and subsequent storage.
